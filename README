INSTALLATION

There is a binary distribution for the Linux (RPM) and one for the Windows
platform, and two source distributions, a full and a 'crippled' one.  The
crippled version has no Milky Way and no nebulae data, and it doesn't contain
the CWEB source code making it more difficult to adjust the source to your
compiler's peculiarities.

The only really critical point is that PP3 needs to find its data files (all
files with the .dat extension).  By default it looks for them in the current
directory.  If you don't like that, you can move them to another directory and
set the environment variable PP3DATA to that directory.  It it also possible to
recompile PP3 with a different default data directory.

If you compile PP3 you may have problems with the fmax, fmin, and fdim
functions that may be undefined for certain compiler versions.  In this case
recreate PP3's C++ source code from the CWEB source code by deleting the file
pp3.cc and calling

make CHANGEFILE=fmax.ch

You first may want to change some paths at the beginning of the Makefile before
you use it.


USAGE

See below for the documentation.  But for a quick test, enter the examples/
directory and say

pp3 leo.pp3

The result should be a file leo.eps with the constellation of Lion.


DOCUMENTATION

The documentation of PP3 is its well-documented source code.  Its header tells
you how you can make a neat pp3.ps from it.  This may have been done already
for your distribution.  In this case, just print pp3.ps or read it with your
favourite PostScript viewer.

Especially the first pages are important, because there usage of PP3 and the
file format of the input scripts is explained.

Another important source of information are the example input scripts in
examples/.


DATABASES

PP3's standard distribution bases on the following original data compilations:

stars          BSC                              Hoffleit & Warren(1)
