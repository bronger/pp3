  <title><wrap class="title">&PP3; <latex code="--">--</latex> Celestial Chart
Generation</wrap></title>
  <author>Torsten Bronger</author>

  <abstract><p>&PP3; creates celestial charts. It generates resolution
independent maps of very high graphical quality. They can be used for example
as illustrations in books or on web pages. You may use own databases or free
ones from the Internet.</p>

</abstract>

  <figure><graphics file="pp3-logo" kind="bitmap"/></figure>

  <p skip="big" style="margin-top: 4ex; font-size: larger">&PP3; is used for
the constellation maps of <url name="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</url>!
(For example, have a look at the <url
name="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus">Cygnus</url> entry.)</p>
    
  <p class="first" style="margin-top: 4ex; font-size: larger"
skip="big">&News;: &PP3; 1.3.1 makes compilation simpler in comparison with
version&nbsp;1.3.  But it doesn't introduce any new features, so you can
download the Windows or RPM distribution&nbsp;1.3 without missing
something.</p>

  <section>
    <heading style="clear: none">Motivation</heading>

    <p>You can find very many programs on the Internet or elsewhere that draw
star charts.  Most of them try to imitate a planetarium or the eyepiece view.
However sometimes one needs such charts for presentational purposes, and the
number of stars or info pop-up windows with distances or diameters are not
important.  For example books have a high typographic standard normally, and
most chart programs would produce output that does not do justice to it.</p>

    <p>Here &PP3; comes into play.  It produces charts that may not be rich
enough in detail for the professional astronomer but they are perfect as
illustrations.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <heading>First overview</heading>

    <p>First of all, if you are interested, you can get it on <url
name="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pp3">&PP3;'s project page</url>.  There
you also find a reference card, a bug report system and a help forum.  Its
licence is a slightly modified &MIT; licence.  But it's free software through
and through.  The `crippled' version has no Milky Way and nebulae data, and no
&CWEB; source code.</p>

    <p>The program itself consists only of one executable file and a data
directory.  In the data directory must be the data files (their file extension
is <verb>.dat</verb>).  The program takes a small text file as input and
produces a &LaTeX; file as output.</p>

    <p>This &LaTeX; file must be processed by a modern &LaTeX; typesetting
system.  Eventually Postscript output is produced which has the big advantage
that it is resolution independent.  It can be successfully converted to &PDF;
as well.</p>

  <section>
    <heading>Examples</heading>

    <figure id="Orion">
      <graphics file="ori" scale="1.2" kind="vector"/> <caption>The default
chart.  Please have a look at a <url name="ori.png">larger view</url>,
too.</caption>
    </figure>

    <p><ref refid="Orion">Figure</ref> shows more or less the default view of
&PP3;, &i.e.; if you don't change very much.  Thus the input script is very
short:
<verbatim style="padding: 1em">
filename output ori.tex
switch eps_output on

objects_and_labels

delete NGC 2478  NGC 1973  NGC 1975 ;
reposition ORI 34 E ;    # Mintaka
reposition ORI 50 W ;    # Alnitak
</verbatim>
This is just a little bit of fine-tuning.  I only have to delete some nebulae
(one of them is a real duplicate in the &NGC; catalogue), and I have to
position two labels because the constellation lines supresses them.</p>

    <figure id="Scorpion">
      <graphics file="sco" kind="bitmap"/>
      <caption>The Scorpion.  (You may click on the picture to get a larger
view.)</caption>
    </figure>

  <p>The following script is more complex.  It produces <ref
refid="Scorpion">figure</ref>:
<verbatim style="padding: 1em">
# Chart of the Scorpion, printable on a black
# and white printer

set constellation SCO
set center_rectascension  17
set center_declination   -30
set grad_per_cm            4.5
set box_width              9
set box_height             7

delete M 18  M 4  NGC 6590  NGC 6634  IC 4700 ;
reposition SCO 20 S ;    # sigma SCO

</verbatim>
Most of the commands change colour to get this black-and-white effect.  There
are also gzipped &EPS; versions of both the <url name="ori.eps.gz">Orion</url>
and the <url name="sco.eps.gz">Scorpion</url> graphics available.</p>

    <heading>Documentation</heading>

    <subsection>
      <heading>Source code</heading>

      <p skip="med">The only full documentation is the <url
name="pp3.pdf">source code</url> itself.  Please don't be afraid – the program
is written in <url
name="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cweb.html">&CWEB;</url>, so
it's full of “human language&rdquo; explanations, and rather easy to read.  The
source is structured so that all relevant information can be found on the first
pages.  There one finds a short introduction with an example and references
within the source code where to get further info.  If someone wants to
contribute, contact me.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <heading>Reference card</heading>

      <p>As already mentioned, there is a neat <url name=
"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71469&amp;release_id=174617"
>reference card</url>.  It can be downloaded for A4 and letter paper in &PDF;
and PostScript format.  If you fold it twice to a zigzag, it's very handy,
too.  <verb>:-)</verb></p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <heading>Wikipedia example scripts</heading>

      <p>&PP3; is responsible for almost all star maps on English <url
name="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</url>, the free encyclopedia.  Since
they can serve very well as examples, all of their source scripts are included
in &PP3;'s distribution, together with all associated files.</p>

  <section>
    <heading>Prerequisites</heading>

    <p>&PP3; creates a &LaTeX; file with the extension <verb>.tex</verb>.
Apparently you cannot directly do something with it.  So you also need:
<description>
	<term>&LaTeX;:</term><item>For Windows, you may want to use the <url
name="http://www.miktex.org">Mik&TeX;</url> distribution, or the <url
name="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">&TeX; Live</url> distribution.  For Linux,
it is either already installed or you can easily install it with your package
manager.  This enables you to use two important commands:<itemize>
	    <item><verb>latex</verb> for transforming the <verb>.tex</verb>
file to a <verb>.dvi</verb> file.</item>
	    <item><verb>dvips</verb> for transforming the <verb>.dvi</verb>
file to a Postscript or EPS file.</item>
	  </itemize>
&PP3; can call these programs for you if you wish.</item>
	<term>Ghostscript:</term><item>This is a program for viewing and
printing Postscript files, and for converting them to &PDF;&sf;.  You need <url
name="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/AFPL/get704.htm">Ghostscript</url>
itself and <url
name="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/get43.htm">GSView</url>.  For Linux
these programs are highly probably already installed.</item>
      </description>
It may seem to be unfortunate that you have to install all these programs only
in order to use &PP3; but fortunately the installation procedures are pretty
easy and the programs are very useful also for many many other purposes.</p>
