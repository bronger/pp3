@top The PP3 program for drawing celestial maps.

@PPTHREE{} generates celestial charts of high (typo)graphical quality.
It uses @LaTeX{} + pstricks for this, so the end formats are
@acronym{EPS} and @acronym{PDF} (in contrast to mere bitmaps).

The program automatically avoids labels that overlap, and you can change
many parameters.  You can place arbitrary text on the map using the
flexibility of the LaTeX language.

@node What it is
@section What it is

There are many programs that can create stellar maps.  But none of them
reaches @PPTHREE{}'s typographic and graphical quality.  In contrast to
other programs @PPTHREE{} produces vector images
(e.@s{}g.@:@tie{}@acronym{PDFs}) rather than mere bitmaps.  Therefore it
is perfectly suited for creating illustrations for books or other print
media, and for web pages.

@PPTHREE{} is optimised for the semi-automatic generation of large sets
of sky maps.  It has decent default behaviour, however it can be
customised very flexibly.  It tries to take as much fine-tuning work
away from you as possible.


@node What it is not
@section What it is not

But I must also point out what @PPTHREE{} is @emph{not}.  It cannot help
you to professionally prepare your next observation night, nor is
@PPTHREE{} a visualisation tool for astronomical databases, with pop-up
window information for every sky object on the screen.

In fact, @PPTHREE{} not even has a graphical user interface.  So don't
expect any windows at all, and your mouse will be useless.  Instead,
@PPTHREE{} reads from one file and writes to another file.  (This is
done not only because its author was lazy but because it increases
efficiency, too.)  So, the program itself is quite stinted, but its
results are worth it!


@node Successful use of PP3
@section Successful use of PP3

@unnumberedsubsec Wikipedia

@PPTHREE{} has been used for the celestial maps of all 88 constellations
on @uref{http://@/www.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia}, the free encyclopedia.
Feel free to browse through a
@uref{http://wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=List_of_constellations,list
of all constellations}.

This is a web page, so you need bitmaps@footnote{as long as we don't
have @acronym{SVG}}, and a short @uref{http://www.gimp.org,Gimp}
script@footnote{which is included into the distribution} helped me to
convert @PPTHREE{}'s @acronym{EPS} vector output to @acronym{PNG}
bitmaps.  Additionally, this script creates smaller thumbnail version
for all charts that exceed a certain width.

The result is that one can create all maps plus their thumbnails with
one simple command call:

@example
make
@end example

@noindent
Surely it can't become simpler.  You may retort ``Well, but creating the
maps must have been the actual work''.  Of course it was, but first it
took only 10--15 minutes per map eventually, because much work is done
by the default behaviour of @PPTHREE{} itself.  And secondly:

@unnumberedsubsec French Wikipedia

Several months later the @uref{http://fr.wikipedia.org,French division
of Wikipedia} wanted to translate the maps to French.  They wanted
another background colour and French labels and constellation names.
They provided me with a translation table.  It took me three hours to
adjust the scripts, to run @file{make} again, and to upload the
@acronym{ZIP} file with all the demanded bitmaps.

@unnumberedsubsec h2g2

Originally @PPTHREE{} was written for a project on
@uref{http://www.bbc.co.uk/h2g2/guide/,h2g2}, an @emph{edited} Internet
encyclopedia.  Unfortunately the BBC editors wanted very small bitmaps
that would not have been helpful, and they were too lazy to include all
the 88@tie{}bitmaps.  So the project died, but on a smaller scale (for
ten constellations or so), it indeed motivated authors to contribute
articles about constellations.  The maps were externally linked.


@node Installation
@chapter Installation

You can get the latest @PPTHREE{} file releases from
@uref{http://@/sourceforge.net/projects/pp3,@PPTHREE{}'s project page on
Sourceforge}.  The main @PPTHREE{} distribution comes as several files,
namely

@table @file
@item pp3-@var{version}-win.zip
is the complete Windows distribution.

@item pp3-@var{version}-1tb.i386.rpm
is the complete Linux RPM distribution.  (There is also the
corresponding source RPM called @file{pp3-@var{version}-1tb.src.rpm}.)

@item pp3-@var{version}.tar.bz2
is the complete source distribution.

@item pp3-@var{version}-cripple.tar.gz
is a partial source distribution.  Milky Way, Nebulae, and the
@acronym{CWEB} source code are omitted.

@end table

@noindent
Obviously you need only @emph{one} of these files.

@end menu


@node Windows
@section Installation on Windows

Although @PPTHREE{} runs independently from other programs, it is not
useful when it's alone.  It needs two external tools in order to work
properly: @TeX{} and Ghostscript.

@center @emph{You need not know how to use @TeX{} and Ghostscript!}

On most Unix/Linux systems @TeX{} and Ghostscript are already installed.
But on Windows, you have to install them yourself.  Fortunately this is
not difficult, and both programs may be useful for other purposes, too.

@menu
* Getting TeX::                 Installing the TeX typesetting engine.

@end menu


@node Getting TeX
@subsection Getting @TeX{}

@TeX{} is a mighty typesetter.  @PPTHREE{} calls @TeX{} in order to
actually create the stellar map.  The result is a Postscript file.

There are two major @TeX{} variants for Windows, namely
@uref{http://www.miktex.@/org,Mik@TeX{}} and
@uref{http://www.tug.org/texlive/,@TeX{}@tie{}Live}.  Both are rather
similar in their functionality, and both come with a nice installation
tool.  Please assure that the @t{pstricks} package as part of @TeX{} is
installed, however this is highly probable anyway.


@node Getting Ghostscript
@subsection Getting Ghostscript

The best tool for dealing with Postscript files is
@uref{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/@/~ghost/doc/AFPL/get811.htm,Ghostscript}.
In particular, if you've installed Ghostscript, PP3 is able to generate
PDF files for you.  It is wise (although not necessary) to install
@uref{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/get45.htm,GSView}, too.  It
lets you view arbitrary Postscript files on screen.


@node Installing PP3
@subsection Installation of PP3 itself

When @TeX{} and Ghostscript are in the right place, you finish the
installation by unpacking the @PPTHREE{} @acronym{ZIP} file and copying
its content in the proper directories:

@enumerate
@item
Copy @file{pp3.exe} to an arbitrary directory that is in your
@env{PATH}.

@item
Copy all the other files to @emph{one single} arbitrary directory.  Then
set the environment variable @env{PP3DATA} to this directory.

@end enumerate

For the sake of simplicity, I recommend to copy everything to
@file{C:\Programs\pp3} and to set your @env{PATH} environment variable
to

@display
@code{@var{old PATH};C:\Programs\pp3}
@end display

@noindent
and to set the @env{PP3DATA} environment variable to
@file{C:\Programs\pp3}.  That's it.


@node Linux
@section Installation on Linux

@menu
* RPM installation::            The simple way.
* Building from sources::       The hard way.
@end menu

Before you install @PPTHREE{}, ensure that @TeX{} and Ghostscript are
installed.


@node RPM installation
@subsection @acronym{RPM} installation

You should consider to use the @acronym{RPM} file, because it is the
simplest installation.  It works for SuSE Linux and probably also for
Red@s{}Hat.  Just enter (as root)

@display
@code{rpm -i @var{RPM-file-name}}
@end display

@noindent
That's it.


@node Building from sources
@subsection Building from sources

(Actually you can compile the sources on Windows, too (of course), but
since most people who do compile are Linux users, I dare to put it in
the Linux section.)

@PPTHREE{} is written in @acronym{CWEB}@.  This is special form of C++
and can be transformed to real C++ trivially.  You only need the
@uref{http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/@/~knuth/cweb.html,@acronym{CWEB}
programs} installed.  For your convenience the C++ code of @PPTHREE{} is
included into the source distribution, so you need @acronym{CWEB} only
if you want to modify the program.

There is no @file{configure} script.  Just call @code{make} and (as
root) @code{make install}.  Before that, you may want to adjust some
paths in the @file{Makefile}.

@PPTHREE{} looks for its data files (all files with the @file{.dat}
extension) in a special directory that is pre-compiled in the
executable.  The Makefile assures that this is the correct one, but you
can override that with the environment variable @env{PP3DATA}.


@node Increase TeX's memory
@section Increase @TeX{}'s memory

There is exactly one object that can need a lot of memory: the Milky
Way.  Therefor it's switched off by default.  But if you want to see the
Milky Way on your maps, you probably should set the main memory size of
your @TeX{} distribution to its maximal value.  This is very
implementation specific.  With te@TeX{} (Linux) you have to find the
file @file{texmf.cnf} and set `@code{main_memory.latex}' to 7500000.
Then call (as root)

@example
fmtutil --byfmt latex
@end example

@noindent
With fp@TeX{}/@TeX{}@s{}Live (Windows) it's the same.

Mik@TeX{} however (Windows too) is different.  Look for a directory
called @file{localtexmf}.  Then create the file@footnote{It may be
necessary to create the sub directories, too.}
@file{localtexmf\miktex\config\miktex.ini} and write

@example
mem_max=7500000
@end example

@noindent
in it.

Alternatively (albeit not cleanly), look for an existing file called
@file{miktex.ini} and change the line with @code{mem_max} to the above.

@sp 1
These are the most common @TeX{} variants.  For others please have a
look in the manual of your @TeX{} distribution for definitive
information.


@node Basic astronomical terms
@chapter Basic astronomical terms

The following is a mere crash course.  It is supposed to enable you to
use @PPTHREE{} even if you have not the slightest idea about how
astronomers describe the sky.

Readers competent in astronomy may skip it, although
@ref{Constellations} and @ref{Catalogues} contain minor program
peculiarities, too.

* Magnitudes::                  Stellar brightnesses.

* Catalogues::                  How to name one particular sky
                                  object properly.
@end menu


@node Celestial coordinate system
@section Celestial coordinate system

On a sheet of paper, every point has an @math{x} and a @math{y}
coordinate (if you draw two axes).  On planet Earth, every location has
a @emph{longitude} and a @emph{latitude}.

With a very similar system astronomers give the coordinates of every
point in the sky.  The sky longitude is called @emph{rectascension} and
the sky latitude is called @emph{declination}.  There is a sky North
Pole (near the Polar Star), a sky South Pole, and a sky equator.  You
can make globes of the sky like of the Earth, with the only difference
that you must imagine being @emph{inside} the globe.

So the rectascension is the @math{x} coordinate in a way.  It is given
in `hours' (h) from 0@dmn{h} to 24@dmn{h}.  Since the sky is round, both
0@dmn{h} and 24@dmn{h} are the same rectascension, and 12@dmn{h} is the
opposite to it.

Usually the fraction of the rectascension that is smaller than 1@dmn{h}
is given in minutes and seconds, however in @PPTHREE{} the rectascension
is one decimal fraction number.

The declination corresponds to the @math{y} coordinate.  It is measured
from @math{-90^\circ} (South Pole) over @math{0^\circ} (equator) to
@math{+90^\circ} (North Pole).


@node Magnitudes
@section The system of magnitudes

Theoretically you could measure the brightness of stars in Watts like
the power of a light bulb.  But this is rather awkward.  Instead,
astronomers use the system of @emph{magnitudes}@tie{}(m).

The brighter a star, the smaller is its magnitude.  Sirius is the
brightest star in the sky, and its brightness is @math{-1.6}@dmn{m}.
Vega has a brightness of @math{0.0}@dmn{m}, and Polaris, the Pole Star,
of @math{2.0}@dmn{m}.  The faintest stars that you can see with the
naked eye in a very clear sky have @math{6}@dmn{m}.

The faintest stars in the standard catalogue of @PPTHREE{} are of
approx.@tie{}@math{7}@dmn{m}, however extremely good terrestrial
telescopes can see up to @math{22}@dmn{m}.


@node Constellations
@section Constellations

Since the 1930s, the sky is officially divided into 88 constellations.
At that time, the boundaries between the constellations were clearly
defined, too: namely by the coordinates of sky points that, when
connected with their respective neighbours, create the boundaries.

Every constellation has a Latin name and a three letter abbreviation.
For example ``Orion -- Ori'', or ``Ursa Major -- UMa'' (Great Bear), or
``Hydrus -- Hyi'' (Male Water Snake).  This abbreviation plays a big
role in @PPTHREE{} because it's the only way to denote a constellation.
You must use only uppercase letters in the abbreviation.

One constellation, the snake or ``Serpens'', is divided into two parts,
``Serpens Caput'' (Head) and ``Serpens Cauda'' (Tail).  They are
abbreviated @code{SER1} and @code{SER2} in @PPTHREE{}.  If you say
@code{SER} only, you mean both parts.


@node Catalogues
@section Catalogues: Flamsteed, Henry Draper, NGC/IC and Messier

When you use @PPTHREE{} you have to tell the program e.@s{}g.@: which
star you want to delete from the map or which nebula shall get a
different label.  For this, every sky object must have a distinct name
in @PPTHREE{}.

By and large there are two kinds of objects in the sky: stars and
nebulae.  Astronomers have created many catalogues of them.  There are
two star catalogues and three nebulae catalogues supported in
@PPTHREE{}.

@menu
* Denoting stars::              How stars get a name in PP3.
* Denoting nebulae::            How nebulae get a name in PP3.
@end menu


@node Denoting stars
@subsection Denoting stars

The two star catalogues are the Flamsteed and the Henry Draper
(@acronym{HD}) numbers.  Flamsteed gave numbers beginning with `1' to
stars in each constellation.  The Flamsteed catalogue is small and
doesn't contain the complete southern sky.  In contrast to that, the
@acronym{HD} catalogue doesn't distinguish between constellations, it
covers the whole sky, and also contains faint stars.  However the
@acronym{HD} names are harder to read.

For example Rigel, @math{\beta}@tie{}Ori, can be identified in
@PPTHREE{} with either

@example
ORI 19
@end example

@noindent
where `@code{ORI}' is Rigel's constellation (Orion) and `@code{19}' the
Flamsteed number; or with

@example
HD 34085
@end example

@noindent
where `@code{34085}' is Rigel's Henry Draper catalogue number.  Both are
totally equivalent.  The program
@uref{http://@/www.@/shatters.@/net/@/celestia/,Celestia} is very useful
for finding Flamsteed or @acronym{HD} numbers.


@node Denoting nebulae
@subsection Denoting nebulae

The two nebula catalogues @acronym{NGC} and @acronym{IC} are
complementary, i.@s{}e.@: they don't have@footnote{well, shouldn't have}
any nebulae in common.  For example, the North America Nebula is called
`@code{NGC 7000}' and the Orion Nebula is '@code{NGC 1976}'.  The
@acronym{IC} catalogue usually contains fainter objects.

Parallel to that there is the much older and much smaller Messier
catalogue, abbreviated@tie{}`M'.  For example, the Orion Nebula can also
be called '@code{M 42}', whereas the North America Nebula isn't included
in Messier's catalogue.

Pay attention to

@itemize
@item
the catalogue abbreviation in all uppercase and

@item
the space between the catalogue abbreviation and the number.

@end menu


@node Invocation
@section Starting PP3

Invoking @PPTHREE{} is very straightforward.  Since it is a command line
program you only have to call it somehow and give a so-called input
script as the parameter, see @ref{Input scripts}.  For example, entering

@example
pp3 orion.pp3
@end example

@noindent
on the command line starts @PPTHREE{} and lets it generate the file
@file{orion.pdf}, which is a @acronym{PDF} file with a star map of
Orion.  You can view this @acronym{PDF} with Acrobat Viewer, convert it
to a bitmap, or you can embed it into a text of yours.

To be honest, there are three possible output formats.  By default,
@PPTHREE{} generates a @LaTeX{} file in the current directory.  But most
people cannot do much with it, therefore certain commands in the input
script trigger @acronym{EPS} or @acronym{PDF} output, see @ref{Output
control}.

@PPTHREE{} can't generate bitmaps.  If you need bitmaps you must use a
bitmap program (e.@s{}g.@: Corel Draw or the
@uref{http://www.gimp.org,Gimp}) for that.


@node Using pipes
@section Using pipes

Especially on Unix it is very common to read from standard input and to
write to standard output.  I don't think that this is sensible for
@PPTHREE{}, but anyway, I included this facility.  If you give
`@code{-}' as the only parameter, @PPTHREE{} reads the input script from
standard input, and if you don't give an output filename in the input
script (@pxref{Input scripts}), @PPTHREE{} writes to standard output.

@node Minimal example
@section Minimal example input script

The minimal @PPTHREE{} input script is -- well -- the empty file.  Then
@PPTHREE{}'s default values create a dark blue star map of Orion:

@image{orion,10cm,,Constellation map of Orion}

@c Image can be created with the following PP3 input script:
@c
@c filename output orion.tex
@c switch pdf_output on

You can override these defaults step by step.  Let's do so: Write

@example
# Cygnus, the Swan

filename output swan.tex
switch pdf_output on

set center_rectascension  19.95
set center_declination    40.8
@end example

@noindent
to the file @file{swan.pp3} and call

@example
pp3 swan.pp3
@end example

@noindent
The result is a file @file{swan.pdf} in the current directory with a
star map of the Swan.

The lines of @file{swan.pp3} are not difficult to explain:  The very
first line is a comment.  Everything that starts with a @code{#} is a
comment.  You can write descriptive text in them to make the file more
readable.

The line

@example
filename output swan.tex
@end example

@noindent
makes @PPTHREE{} to write the generated map to the file
@file{swan.tex}.  But such a file is rarely the desired output.
Therefore the next line

@example
switch pdf_output on
@end example

@noindent
tells @PPTHREE{} that we want to have a @acronym{PDF} file.  So
@PPTHREE{} does everything necessary for that.  And finally,

@example
set center_rectascension  19.95
set center_declination    40.8
@end example

@noindent
denotes the area of the sky that we want to be displayed.  Both values
indicate the celestial point that we want to have in the centre of the
map.  In this case, 19.95@dmn{h} rectascension and @math{+40.8^\circ}
declination which is the centre of the constellation Swan.


@node More bells and wistles
@section More bells and wistles

Let's continue with our Swan example of the previous section.

Normally the Milky Way is switched off, because it consumes a lot of
memory, see @ref{Increase TeX's memory}.  However it looks rather nice,
so let's switch it on:

@example
switch milky_way on
@end example

Maybe you want to use the map in a book that is supposed to be printed
in black and white.  Then the current colour scheme is disadvantageous.
The following lines redefine it:

@smallexample
color nebulae                 0    0    0
color background              1    1    1
color grid                    0.5  0.5  0.5
color ecliptic                0.3  0.3  0.3
color constellation_lines     0.7  0.7  0.7
color labels                  0    0    0
color boundaries              0.8  0.8  0.8
color highlighted_boundaries  0    0    0
color milky_way               0.5  0.5  0.5
@end smallexample

@noindent
Colours are given as red--green--blue values, for forther information
see @ref{Colours}.  With these redefinitions, all elements on the map
are printed either in black, or in white, or in shades of grey.

A speacial problem are stars.  With

@example
color stars 0 0 0
@end example

@noindent
stars are printed in black colour, one could think.  But this is not
always true.  By default, stars get their `real' colour according to
their B@minus{}V brightness.  For example, Saiph in Orion is a little
bit blue, while Antares in Scorpius is known to be red.  Therefore
@PPTHREE{} ignores any `@code{color}' directive for stars, unless you
also say

@example
switch colored_stars off
@end example

Last but not least you should change the @emph{highlighted
constellation}.  By default, it's Orion.  But we want to highlight the
Swan, so we say

@example
set constellation CYG
@end example

@noindent
because ``Cyg'' is the astronomical abbreviation of the Swan (``Cygnus''
in Latin).  Highlighting means that its borderline gets another colour.

This is the map that results from all this (I removed the Milky Way from
this figure in order to keep the @acronym{PDF} manual small):

@image{swan,10cm,,Constellation map of the Swan}

@c Image can be created with the following PP3 input script:
@c
@c filename output swan.tex
@c switch colored_stars off
@c color stars 0 0 0
@c color nebulae 0 0 0
@c color background 1 1 1
@c color grid 0.5 0.5 0.5

@c switch pdf_output on

@c set center_rectascension  19.95
@c set center_declination    40.8
@c set constellation CYG


@node Parameters and commands
@section Parameters and Commands

Every @PPTHREE{} file can contain @emph{parameters} and
@emph{commands}.  So far, we've had parameters only.  Both types of
keywords must be neatly separated in the input script.  First come the
parameters, then the special keyword

@example
objects_and_labels
@end example

@noindent
and then the commands.  The purpose of the commands is adding and
deleting objects and their labels, to reposition the labels, and to add
arbitrary text on the map.  Let's begin with that.


@node Changing labels
@section Changing labels

I change the label for Deneb, the alpha star in the Swan.  At the
moment, its label is a mere `@math{\alpha}'.  But Deneb has a real name,
and with

@example
set_label_text CYG 50 Deneb
@end example

@noindent
I change the label text to ``Deneb''.  This `@code{CYG 50}' is the
astronomical name for Deneb, see @ref{Denoting stars}.

You can use that also for changing the label for a nebula:

@example
set_label_text NGC 7000 "N. America Neb."
@end example

@noindent
Please note that you have to enclose the label text in quotation marks
if it contains spaces.

Now we get (only the changed part printed):

@image{swan1,,,Map of North America Nebula and Deneb}

@c Image can be created with the following PP3 input script:
@c
@c filename output swan1.tex
@c switch milky_way off
@c switch colored_stars off
@c color stars 0 0 0
@c color nebulae 0 0 0
@c color background 1 1 1
@c color grid 0.5 0.5 0.5
@c color ecliptic 0.3 0.3 0.3
@c color constellation_lines 0.7 0.7 0.7
@c color labels 0 0 0
@c color text_labels 0.5 0.5 0.5
@c color boundaries 0.8 0.8 0.8
@c color highlighted_boundaries 0 0 0
@c color milky_way 0.5 0.5 0.5
@c switch pdf_output on
@c
@c set center_rectascension  21.1
@c set center_declination    44
@c set box_width 7
@c set box_height 3.5
@c set constellation CYG
@c
@c objects_and_labels
@c
@c set_label_text CYG 50 Deneb
@c set_label_text NGC 7000 "N. America Neb."

@PPTHREE{} takes star names from a file.  So if you use another star
data file with @PPTHREE{}, you get other labels.  @PPTHREE{}'s standard
file only contains the astronomical symbols for the stars, so if you
want to have real stars, you must use `@code{set_text_label}' as above.
@xref{Stars data file}, for more information.


@node Reposition labels
@section Reposition labels

If you think that @PPTHREE{} mispositioned a label you can change that
with `@code{reposition}':

@example
reposition M 39  S ;
@end example

@noindent
This puts the label for the nebula M@s{}39 @emph{below} the nebula.
`@code{S}'@tie{}means `south'.  The following diagram shows the possible
values for the direction, by and large you know it from the wind rose:

@image{pp3rose,,,Possible values for `reposition' and `towards'}

@ifinfo
@noindent
The `X' marks the spot that lies @emph{exactly} on the celestial
coordinates given after the `@code{at}' keyword.  Actually there are two
other possible values, namely `@code{W_}' and `@code{E_}' that can be
seen only in the printed or HTML version of this manual.  They are like
`@code{W}' and `@code{E}' except that the X lies on the text baseline
rather than the centre of the vertical edge.
@end ifinfo

@ifnotinfo
@noindent
The red point marks the spot that lies @emph{exactly} on the celestial
coordinates given after the `@code{at}' keyword.
@end ifnotinfo

Using `@code{reposition}' is also necessary if @PPTHREE{} has supressed
a label because it hadn't found a good place for it, because
`@code{reposition}' forces a label to be printed.


@node Text labels
@section Text labels

Changing existing labels is a nice thing to do, however sometimes you
want to add arbitrary text on the map, e.@s{}g.@: `Pleiades' or `Virgo
galaxy cluster'.  For all user defined text there is the keyword
`@code{text}'.  For example,

@example
text "Virgo galaxy cluster" at 12.7 10
  color 0.0 0.0 0.9333 towards SE ;
@end example

@noindent
This places the text `Virgo galaxy cluster' at the celestial coordinates
12.7@dmn{h} rectascension and @math{+10^\circ} declination in blue
colour.  @xref{Colours} for how to denote colours in @PPTHREE{}.

The keyword `@code{towards}'


@node Using flexes
@section Using flexes

But the `@code{text}' keyword can do more.  When you include the
keywords `@code{along declination}' the label becomes a @emph{flex}.
This is printed along a declination circle as a curved text.  It's
especially nice for constellation names.  So let's try it out:

@example
text "\\bfseries Swan" at 20.05 49.8 along declination towards SW ;
@end example

@noindent
This `@code{\\bfseries}' tells the typesetter to print it in @b{bold
face}, see @ref{LaTeX in labels}.  The result is the following:

@image{swan2,,,Map of Swan with a flex label}

@c Image can be created with the following PP3 input script:
@c
@c filename output swan2.tex
@c switch milky_way off
@c switch colored_stars off
@c color stars 0 0 0
@c color nebulae 0 0 0
@c color background 1 1 1
@c color grid 0.5 0.5 0.5
@c color ecliptic 0.3 0.3 0.3
@c color constellation_lines 0.7 0.7 0.7
@c color labels 0 0 0
@c color text_labels 0.5 0.5 0.5
@c color boundaries 0.8 0.8 0.8
@c color highlighted_boundaries 0 0 0
@c color milky_way 0.5 0.5 0.5
@c switch pdf_output on
@c
@c set center_rectascension  21.1
@c set center_declination    44
@c set box_width 7
@c set box_height 3.5
@c set constellation CYG
@c
@c objects_and_labels
@c
@c set_label_text CYG 50 Deneb
@c set_label_text NGC 7000 "N. America Neb."
@c
@c text "\\bfseries Swan" at 20.05 49.8 along declination towards SW ;


@node Tic labels
@section Tic mark labels

But `@code{text}' can do even more.  With

@example
text "$#3$" at 0 20 along declination
            tics rectascension 1 towards N ;
text "$#5$" at 11 0 along declination
            tics declination 10 towards S ;
@end example

@noindent
you create automatic tic mark labels at the declination and
rectascension circles.

`@code{0 0 0}' is black and `@code{1 1 1}' is white.

For shades of grey all three values must be the same.  So a medium grey
is `@code{0.5 0.5 0.5}'.  For further examples have a look at the

@kwindex rim
Set the significance of an overlap with the label's rim relatively to

@node Flexes
@subsubsection Flexes

@deffn Command text {label-text} @code{at} rectascension declination [@code{along} @code{declination}] @code{;}
Create a flex label at the given coordinates.  A flex label follows the
respective declination circle.

@subsubsection Tic mark labels

@deffn Command text {label-text} @code{at} rectascension declination [@code{tics} (@code{rectascension} | @code{declination}) step] @code{;}
@end deffn

@noindent
With the keyword @code{rectascension}, one rectascension circle gets tic
marks, analogously with @code{declination}.  The celestial position
after `@code{at}' denotes the starting point of the labelling, and
@var{step} is the step skip (in hours or degrees respectively) for the
subsequent tic mark labels.

The label should contain one of the following special expressions:

@table @code
@item #1
Rectascension in hours.

@item #2
Declination in degrees.

@item #3
Rectascension in integer hours (truncated, not rounded).

@item #4
Rectascension fraction of hour in minutes (truncated, not rounded).

@item #5
Declination in rounded integer degrees.

@end table

For further options see @ref{Arbitrary text}.  Tic mark labels can also
be flexes, see @ref{Flexes}.


@node PP3 and LaTeX
@chapter PP3 and LaTeX

We're entering now the phase of sophistication.  Here you learn how to
customise the graphical appearence of all text on your sky map almost
arbitrarily.  You also learn how to achieve special text effects using
the @LaTeX{} language.

I can't explain @LaTeX{} itself though.  So I must assume that you've
been taught the basics elsewhere.  On the other hand, the @LaTeX{}
snippets that I will give in this chapter may be enough for most
purposes.

Maybe you want to use your own data bases with @PPTHREE{}.  If they are
not too large@footnote{Unfortunately @PPTHREE{} still has the
disadvantageous behaviour of reading the @emph{whole} data base file.}
you may well do so.  Of course, then you need to know the internal
structure of the files.  Although they are so simple that reverse
engineering should be almost trivial, you find here a complete
description of all of them.

Additionally I will give information where the original data of
@PPTHREE{}'s standard distribution came from.

The last point, the ``label dimensions file'', isn't a real data base
file, but an internal temporary file.  It is mentioned here just for
completeness.

@node Stars data file
@section Stars data file

This is a text file usually called @file{stars.dat}.  Four consecutive
lines belong together and refer to one particular star.  There is no
header.

@table @asis
@item Line 1
A row with seven fields separated by whitespace:

@enumerate
@item
Henry Draper Catalogue number (`@code{0}' if unknown),

@item 
BSC catalogue number (`@code{0}' if unknown),

@item
rectascension in hours,

@item
declination in degrees,

@item
B@minus{}V brightness in magnitudes (`@code{99.0}' if unknown), and

@item

The label (astronomical name) for the star, as a @LaTeX{}-ready string,
e.@s{}g.@: ``@code{$\alpha$}'', ``@code{$\phi^@{2@}$}'', or simply
``@code{$23$}''.  May be the empty string.

@item Line 3
The astronomical abbreviation of the constellation.  It must be all
uppercase.

@item Line 4
The spectral class.  It must start with the spectral class letter,
followed by the fraction digit, followed by the luminosity class as a

@subheading PP3's star data origin

It's the Bright Stars Catalogue (@acronym{BSC}) as distributed with the
program @uref{http://www.stargazing.net/astropc/,Cartes du Ciel}.  It
contains almost 10,000@tie{}stars.  I corrected minor mistakes and let
all double stars collapse, i.@s{}e.@: their visual brightnesses were
summed up and the respective minor partner was removed from the file.


@node Nebulae data file
@section Nebulae data file

This is a text file usually called @file{nebulae.dat}.  There is no
header.  The file is just a whitespace separated stream of numbers and
constellation abbreviations.  In order to make it more readable though,
the standard @PPTHREE{} nebulae file has every nebula on one single line
of its own.

Each dataset has the following eleven fields:

@enumerate
@item
@acronym{NGC} catalogue number (`@code{0}' is not listed there),

@item
@acronym{IC} catalogue number(`@code{0}' is not listed there),

@item
Messier Catalogue number(`@code{0}' is not listed there),

@item

uppercase.

@item
rectascension in hours,

@item
declination in degrees,

@item
visual brightness in magnitudes,

@item
large diameter in degree minutes,

@item
small diameter in degree minutes (must be equal to the large diameter if
unknown),

@item
the horizontal angle if the large diameter in degrees (`@code{720.0}' if
unknown), and

@item
the type of the nebula: 0:@tie{}unknown, 1:@tie{}galaxy,
2:@tie{}emission nebula, 3:@tie{}reflection nebula, 4:@tie{}open star
cluster, and 5:@tie{}globular star cluster.

@node Lines data file
@section Constellation lines data file

This is a text file usually called @file{lines.dat}.  It has no header.
You can define paths of constellation lines by lists of stars that are
ended with a semicolon@tie{}`@code{;}'.  You can insert superfluous
whitespace as you wish, and comments after every@tie{}`@code{#}'.

Stars are given in the usual way: Either by a pair of constellation
abbreviation and Flamsteed number, as in

@example
ORI 19
@end example

@noindent
(Rigel), or by `@code{HD}' and the Henry Draper catalogue number, as in

@example

(Acrux).

@subheading PP3's constellation lines origin

I created the lines after my fancy.  The @emph{Atlas f@"ur

@acronym{ISBN}@tie{}3440074889} was an important source of inspiration
though.


@node Boundaries data file
@section Boundaries data file

It doesn't make much sense to use an own boundaries file, unless you
want to use a different equinox, but anyway.  This is a text file
usually called @file{boundaries.dat}.  It has no header.

The file is a sequence of elementary line segments.  Every segment is a
whitespace separated sequence of entries.  The entries for each segment
are:

@enumerate
@item
Number of points @math{n_1} in the segment.

@item
Repeated @math{n_1} times:

@enumerate
@item
rectascension of point in hours,
@item
declination of point in
degrees.
@end enumerate

@item
Number of constellations @math{n_2} touching this border line (is
always@tie{}2, however it hasn't always been due to flawed raw data).

@item
Repeated @math{n_2} times: All uppercase astronomical abbreviation of
the adjacent constellation. It may distinguish between @code{SER1} and
@code{SER2} for Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda.

@subheading PP3's boundary data origin

It's the @uref{ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/cats/@/VI/49/,Catalogue of
Constellation Boundary Data} by Davenhall and Leggett.  I had to fix
some bugs though, because the Ophiuchus/Serpens region was flawed.
Additionally, the original data has peculiarities because it tries to be
useful for bounded maps, e.@s{}g.@: in Mercator projection.  I removed
the resulting spurious lines.


@node Milky Way data file
@section Milky Way data file

This is a text file usually called @file{milkyway.dat}.

Its header is extremely simple: It consists of only one number which is
the maximal (=@tie{}equatorial) diagonal half distance of two pixels in
degrees. This value is used as the radius for the milky way pixels.  Of
course it must be the minimal radius for which there are no gaps between
the pixels.

What follows are the Milky Way pixels themselves.  Each consists of tree
entries, separated by white space:

@enumerate
@item
The rectascension in hours,

@item
the declination in degrees, and

@item
the grey value of the pixel from 1@tie{}to@tie{}255.  Zero is not used
because zero-value pixels are not included into the data file anyway.

the Gimp, and then transformed to @PPTHREE{}'s format with a small
hand-written C program.

This file is never user provided but generated by @PPTHREE{} itself in
