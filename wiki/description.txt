This is a celestial map of the constellation 

Copyright &copy; 2003 [[User:Bronger|Torsten Bronger]].

It was created by [[User:Bronger|Torsten Bronger]] using the program PP3 on 2003/09/06.  At [http://pp3.sourceforge.net PP3's homepage], you also get the input scripts necessary for re-compiling the map.

The yellow dashed lines are constellation boundaries, the red dashed line is the ecliptic, and the shades of blue show Milky Way areas of different brightness.  The map contains all Messier objects, except for colliding ones. The underlying database contains all stars brighter than 6.5.  All coordinates refer to equinox 2000.0.

The map is calculated with the equidistant azimuthal projection (the zenith being in the center of the image).  The north pole is to the top.  The (horizontal) lines of equal declination are drawn for 0&deg;, &plusmn;10&deg;, &plusmn;20&deg; etc.  The lines of equal rectascension are drawn for all 24&nbsp;hours.  The scale of the map is (approx.) 11.8 pixel per degree at the centre of the bitmap.  Towards the rim there is a very slight magnification (and distortion).



3 grad/cm:  15.7 pixel per degree
4 grad/cm:  11.8 pixel per degree
5 grad/cm:  9.4 pixel per degree
6 grad/cm:  7.9 pixel per degree
10 grad/cm: 4.7 pixel per degree
